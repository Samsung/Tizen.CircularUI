# ConfirmationPopup
`ConfirmationPopup` represents Tizen Wearable EFL Twobutton-popup style. `ConfirmationPopup` is usefull to select one of two options. (e.g  cancel/done, share/delete)

## Create ConfirmationPopup
`ConfirmationPopup.Title` Property set title of popup. you can set `Content` property with Layout such as `StackLayout` or `ScrollView`.
`ConfirmationPopup.FirstButton` property set left side button. `ConfirmationPopup.SecondButton`property set right side button. you can set` FirstButton` and `SecondButton` using `MenuItem`. You should add code at `Command` or `Clicked` event handler for controlling `MenuItem` clicked.

## How to set long Text at ConfirmationPopup
ConfirmationPopup has `Text` Property. This Proerpty is usefull to set long text.
If long text was set by `Text` property. you don't need to add `StackLayout` and `ScrollView` and `Label` for displaying long text.

*`Text` Property's area overlap `Content` Property area. So do not use two propery at the same time.*

**C# file**
```cs
            _popUp2 = new ConfirmationPopup();
            _popUp2.FirstButton = leftButton2;
            _popUp2.SecondButton = rightButton2;
            _popUp2.Title = "Popup title";
            _popUp2.Text = @"This is scrollable popup text.
This part is made by adding long text in popup. Popup internally added
scroller to this layout when size of text is greater than total popup
height. This has two button in action area and title text in title area";
```
