# Xaminals

Xamarin.Forms Shell reduces the complexity of mobile application development by providing the fundamental features that most mobile applications require. This includes a common navigation user experience, a URI-based navigation scheme, and an integrated search handler.

This sample demonstrates a Xamarin.Forms Shell application.

For more information about this sample, see [Xamarin.Forms Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/shell/).
